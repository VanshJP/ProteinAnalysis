Unfortunately, this code ultimately did not work to successfully reproduce the scientific
results of Dr. Duc Nuygen's wonderful team. During this class, the first 2-3 weeks I spent not coding but rather trying to understand science behind the work I was doing. I  had zero knowledge of biology, proteins, and ligands. 

Dr. Rana at first tasked me to understand to some degree what these topics means and how they relate to the work he was doing. At firs, Dr. Rana had me try to work to recreate a paper titled Generalized  Flexibility - Rigidity Index. Here I made code to help analyze the ridigities of the  '1e6j' which is a HIV capsid 1 protein 


After this was finished, Dr. Rana spent a week or two explaining and teaching me about how to do things differently as runtime and code efficiency matter a lot with large, large datasets. Compared to the generalized Flexibility code written, rigidity Strength is more robust as it uses more matrices to process the data 

If you look at the distance.csv file, this is code to calculate the distance between to atoms in and X Y Z axis of a protein. This broke down my laptop over 3 different times because of how computationally expensive it was to trying to run it.  Doing this is how I came about working with Matrices. 


After, I spent about 2 weeks learnig the next paper that I was supposed to analyze called " Rigidity Strengthening: A Mechanism for Protein−Ligand Binding " The research done by this paper can help create ML models in the future that can aid in picking the right protein base for proteins. 

I worked on this paper for quite some times, but It took me a while to grasp what was actually happening and what was being done. Please check out " Rigidity Strengthening_ A Mechanism for Protein−Ligand Binding Code Explained " to see the purpose of the functions and how they relate to the topic at hand. 

Lastly, I attempted to implement a gradient boosting descison tree to help anaylze the binding induced flexibility reduction, but this came out to no success. 

The main issue was the PDB files being used to train the model. This file is 16 gb of data of all various sorts of proteins. There was not "lighter" data set avaliable for this work. 

Setting up the datasets was tough, so I intially decide to prioritize using analysis of the 1e6j protein I had already previously worked with, but the data never ended up looking as to how it "should" have.
